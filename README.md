## Screenshots


* Screen shots for : "View all employees"

![alt text](./screen2.png "Logo Title Text 2")
This screenshot shows the result for "View all employees".  It shows all employees in teh employeeTable (first name, last name, roleid). For the first employee, I managed to get from the roleTable the Title, salary and department id. SO, I could access the role table, but I think there was a code error that prevented me to get the rest of the info. I am going to try to fix it.
